# Speech-emotion-recognition-using-RNN

This repository contains a step-by-step guide that will allow the user to build a speech emotion recognition system from scratch. The user will start working with raw audio files from the RAVDESS database and use an RNN (LSTM) to train and test the model. The final step is to use the speech emotion recognition system in real-time, where the user will be able to use their own recorded voice and see the machine's emotion predictions in the form of emojis!

The entire project was built using Python 3.0 (Anaconda).
