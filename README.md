# Speech-emotion-recognition-using-RNN

This repository contains a step-by-step guide along with the project files necessary to build a speech emotion recognition system from scratch. The user will start working with raw audio files from the RAVDESS database and use an RNN (LSTM) to train and test the model. The final step is to use the speech emotion recognition system in real-time, where the user will be able to use their own recorded speech and see the machine's emotion predictions in the form of emojis!

The project is divided into three steps (directories):

Step 1: Feature extraction
Step 2: Model training and testing
Step 3: Deploying the model

Please go to each directory in the order listed above and complete all the tasks before proceeding to the next.

The entire project was built using Python 3.0 (Anaconda).
